# HackTheBox "Nocturnal" Writeup

## This is my writeup for the HackTheBox machine "Nocturnal". 
It is an easy rated Linux box that required more thought than usual for an easy.
Themes: Web Reconnaisance, Vulnerable Custom Code, Credentials Reuse, SSH Local Portforward, Software Vulnerable to CVE
Tools: ffuf, gobuster, burpsuite, ssh, sqlite3

*As this box is currently active I will update with my writeup when it foes into retirement.*
